I am an aspiring data scientist with almost 3 years of data analytics experience in the financial services sector. I graduated in 2018 from the University of Michigan with a degree in economics and a minor in applied statistics. This portfolio is an active representation of my passion for data-driven solutions and will continue to grow throughout my data science journey.
